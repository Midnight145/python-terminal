Python Terminal
There is no need for this, I have no need for this, I just thought that it would be a fun project.

This is still nowhere close to being done, and right now has a very bad implementation of almost everything.

I am hoping to be able to upload "modules" to GitHub, and be able to pull them from here in the terminal and install them, similar to bash's apt-get. This would let me develop more programs for it and easily use them instead of changing the terminal's code itself.
